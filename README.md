# Getting into Competitive Coding

## Setting up an IDE
I like *Sublime Text* because it's fast and light weight. Another popular choice is *Visual Studio* (paired with some useful extensions). However, anything is fine as it comes down to personal preference.\

## Choosing a language
<details>
  <summary>Spoiler</summary>
 
  It's *C++* and [here's](https://www.codingninjas.com/blog/2018/04/11/the-best-languages-for-competitive-programming) why.\
  **tl;dr**: C++ is the most commmonly used 'fast' language, that also comes with great functionality.
  
  Java is also a popular choice, [however](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-competitive-programmers-prefer-to-use-C++-instead-of-Java-in-the-programming-contests). So if you're not already familiar with C++, it is advised that you switch over; Although you may choose to stick with Java if you feel that it's a better choice. There are infinitely many links on the internet that guide you through the basics of these languages, so none will be mentioned here.

## C++ STL
STL, or Standard Template Library, is a huge library of useful functions. If you're not already familiar with it, [this](https://hackerrank.com/domains/cpp/stl) is a good place to start.

## Getting started
[Here](CC%20Sites.md) is a comprehensive guide on Competitive Coding websites (primarily CodeForces, which I recommend).
Before you actually start it is important to familiarize yourself with the big-O notation. Understanding [Time and Space Complexity](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/complexity-analysis/time-and-space-complexity/tutorial/) is the only prerequisite (apart from knowing a language). Once you've done all this, you're ready to [start](Hello%20world.md).

## One formula for everything
* Here is a [link](https://facebook.com/groups/BPHCCompetitiveCoding/permalink/2368441416724151/) to some very useful posts that cover most beginner topics. **Upsolve every problem** from these posts. Remember that these are only the first 2-3 problems that will introduce you to the topic. It's upto you to **explore further**.

* Once you're familiar with a particular topic, you can go to [problemset](https://codeforces.com/problemset) on Codeforces and filter by tag and/or rating. From there, it's just **practice**, **practice**, **practice**.

* [Virtual Contests](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/70036) are a great way to improve speed. You could have all the conceptual knowledge in the world but that wouldn't mean anything if you aren't fast.

### Formula
Learn new topic > Practice problems > Improve speed > Learn new topic > Practice ... Rinse and repeat.
