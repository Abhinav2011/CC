# Sorting and Binary Search

## STL sort() and custom comparators

Rather than writing your own sort methods , its often easier and faster to use the sort() function present in the C++ Standard Template Library.
However at times , you have to sort custom data structures for which default comparators are not defined.
For such cases you may write a custom comparator and pass it as an arguement to the STL sort() function.

## Binary Search

A method to find an element in a sorted array in logarithmic time. Binary search is useful in finding lower and upper bounds of a value in a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence.
