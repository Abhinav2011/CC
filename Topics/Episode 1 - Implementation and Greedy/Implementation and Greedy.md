Implementation
Implementation problems do not rely on the knowledge of any particular data structure or algorithm and instead require the usage of pure logic. There isn't really any way to learn this method except to practice problems.

Note: Sometimes the input may be large enough to cause an overflow. So remember to use long long (64-bit integer) instead of int (32-bit integer). It is safe to assume anything above 2e9 overflows int, and anything above 2e18 overflows long long int

Greedy
As the name suggests, a greedy approach is one where (greedily) picking the best option at every stage leads to the best outcome.

These problems are only meant to introduce you to the topic and are by no means enough to make you an expert at it (unless you are a genius). Be sure to practice more problems on the topics through the course of the following week. You may go to [https://codeforces.com/problemset] and filter by tag and rating to find appropriate problems. A practice contest on the same will be held next weekend, following which the next set of topics will be announced.
