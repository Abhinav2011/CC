# Implementation and Greedy

## Ad hoc/Implementation
Ad Hoc/Implementation problems do not rely on the knowledge of any particular data structure or algorithm and instead require the usage of pure logic. There isn't really any way to learn this method except to practice problems.

## Greedy

As the name suggests, a greedy approach is one where the *greedily* picking the **best option** at every 'stage' leads to the **best outcome**.
