# Implementation and Greedy

## Ad hoc/Implementation
Ad Hoc/Implementation problems do not rely on the knowledge of any particular data structure or algorithm and instead require the usage of pure logic. There isn't really any way to learn this method except to practice problems.

### Problems
* [Codeforces 1030 A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1030/A)
* [Codeforces 116 A](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/116/A)
* [Codeforces 977 A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/977/A)
* [Codeforces 266 A](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/266/A)
* [Codeforces 282 A](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/282/A)
* [Codeforces 158 A](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/158/A)
* [Codeforces 459 A](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/459/A)
* [Codeforces 1 A](https://codeforces.com/contest/1/problem/A)

**Note:** Sometimes the input may be large enough to cause an overlow (It is safe to assume anything above 2x10<sup>9</sup> overflows). So remember to use long long (64-bit integer) instead of int (32-bit integer).

## Greedy

As the name suggests, a greedy approach is one where the *greedily* picking the **best option** at every 'stage' leads to the **best outcome**.
