# Macros
Anything that starts with a **'#'** is a *preprocessor directive*. A macro is a preprocessor directive which behaves like a find and replace tool. You may read more about it from [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/). 

When it comes to cp, macros can prove to be quite useful.
