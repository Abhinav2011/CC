Resources (I used) starting out

Setting up an IDE:\
I like Sublime Text because it's fast and light. Another popular choice is Visual Studio (paired with Divyanshu's CRUx sellout sorry-not-sorry extension). It's upto personal preference. Just don't use Codechef IDE online (cuz it sucks and is very slow) like a certain someone in this group..\

C++ STL:\
If you're not already familiar with the language, going through this is highly advisable.\

Topics:\
Post says it all. Upsolve every problem. Remember that these are only the first 2-3 problems that will introduce you to the topic. It's upto you to explore further.\

Once you're familiar with a particular topic, you can go to Problemset on Codeforces and search by tag and/or rating. \

From there, it's just practice, practice, practice. Hope this helps :)

Also, Virtual Contests are a thing. You could have all the conceptual knowledge in the world but that wouldn't mean jack if you aren't fast. Virtual contests are the way to go (at least for me) to improve speed.
