# Resources (I used) starting out

## Setting up an IDE
I like *Sublime Text* because it's fast and light weight. Another popular choice is *Visual Studio* (paired with some useful extensions). It comes down to personal preference.\

## Choosing a language
<details>
  <summary>Spoiler</summary>
  
  ```
  It's C++ and [here's](https://www.codingninjas.com/blog/2018/04/11/the-best-languages-for-competitive-programming) why. 
  tl;dr: C++ is the fastest and has a lot of useful functions.
  ```

## C++ STL
STL, or Standard Template Library, is a huge library of useful functions. If you're not already familiar with it, [this](hackerrank.com/domains/cpp/stl) is a good place to start.

## Everything that comes after
* Here is a [link](facebook.com/groups/BPHCCompetitiveCoding/permalink/2368441416724151/) to some very useful posts on FB which covers most beginner topics. Upsolve every problem. Remember that these are only the first 2-3 problems that will introduce you to the topic. It's upto you to explore further.\

* Once you're familiar with a particular topic, you can go to [Problemset](codeforces.com/problemset) on Codeforces and search by tag and/or rating. From there, it's just practice, practice, practice.

* [Virtual Contests](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/70036) are a great way to improve speed. You could have all the conceptual knowledge in the world but that wouldn't mean jack if you aren't fast.

Learn new topic > Practice problems > Improve speed. Rinse and repeat.
