# Resources (I used) starting out

## Setting up an IDE
I like *Sublime Text* because it's fast and light weight. Another popular choice is *Visual Studio* (paired with some useful extensions). However, anything is fine as it comes down to personal preference.\

## Choosing a language
<details>
  <summary>Spoiler</summary>
 
  It's *C++* and [here's](https://www.codingninjas.com/blog/2018/04/11/the-best-languages-for-competitive-programming) why.\
  **tl;dr**: C++ is the fastest and has a lot of useful functions.
  
  If you're not already familiar with this language, it's advised that you switch over. There are infinitely many links on the internet that guide you through the basics, so this blog won't mention any.

## C++ STL
STL, or Standard Template Library, is a huge library of useful functions. If you're not already familiar with it, [this](https://hackerrank.com/domains/cpp/stl) is a good place to start.

## Everything that comes after
* Here is a [link](https://facebook.com/groups/BPHCCompetitiveCoding/permalink/2368441416724151/) to some very useful posts on FB which covers most beginner topics. Upsolve every problem. Remember that these are only the first 2-3 problems that will introduce you to the topic. It's upto you to explore further.

* Once you're familiar with a particular topic, you can go to [Problemset](https://codeforces.com/problemset) on Codeforces and search by tag and/or rating. From there, it's just practice, practice, practice.

* [Virtual Contests](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/70036) are a great way to improve speed. You could have all the conceptual knowledge in the world but that wouldn't mean jack if you aren't fast.

Learn new topic > Practice problems > Improve speed. Rinse and repeat.
