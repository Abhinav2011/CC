# Resources (I used) starting out

## Setting up an IDE
I like *Sublime Text* because it's fast and light weight. Another popular choice is *Visual Studio* (paired with some useful extensions). It comes down to personal preference.\

## C++ STL
STL stands for Standard Template Library. It's a huge library of useful functions. If you're not already familiar with it, [this](hackerrank.com/domains/cpp/stl) is a good place to start.

## Topics
[Link](facebook.com/groups/BPHCCompetitiveCoding/permalink/2368441416724151/) says it all. Upsolve every problem. Remember that these are only the first 2-3 problems that will introduce you to the topic. It's upto you to explore further.\

Once you're familiar with a particular topic, you can go to [Problemset](codeforces.com/problemset) on Codeforces and search by tag and/or rating. From there, it's just practice, practice, practice.

[Virtual Contests](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/70036) are a great way to improve speed. You could have all the conceptual knowledge in the world but that wouldn't mean jack if you aren't fast.
